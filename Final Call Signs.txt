# MorseCodeDecoder

This is my ECE 350 project, they provided a .wav file with multiple morse code call signals, the goal is to extract all the call signals, perferably with time-stamps


I use the following public open source libraries:
- scipy (signal processing and filters)
- numpy (array and numeric progamming)
- openCV (display)
- matplotlib (display)
- ittertools (addvanced itterations)
- collections (advanced data types)


Good final call signs these are syndicated from my multiple methods (SEE GITHUB)

Some do not have time stamps they are from my Rev3 that did not find timestamps because I could not get wroking with time steps and down-sampling complexities.

Time stamps are in seconds.
