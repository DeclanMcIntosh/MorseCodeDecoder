# MorseCodeDecoder

This is my ECE 350 project, they provided a .wav file with multiple morse code call signals, the goal is to extract all the call signals, perferably with time-stamps


I use the following public open source libraries:
- scipy (signal processing and filters)
- numpy (array and numeric progamming)
- openCV (display)
- matplotlib (display)
- ittertools (addvanced itterations)
- collections (advanced data types)
